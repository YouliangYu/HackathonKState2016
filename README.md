# Hack K-State 2016: Data Science Challenge For Social Good

In this challenge, we build BetterDAI: a web application that leverages hardcore
data analysis to ensure hospital patients are treated correct.

Our goal was to predict which patients will be re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of their discharge. 
This is a real problem for hospitals, who don't get paid for a re-admission if it happens within 30 days 
after the patient was discharged, and patients, who would like to live their life outside the walls of 
a hospital and be healthy.

This repo includes the back end machine learning models that actually perform the prediction.
