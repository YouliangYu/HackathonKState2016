# Hack K-State 2016: Data Science Challenge For Social Good

In this hackathon challenge(https://zslie.github.io/), we build BetterDAI(https://devpost.com/software/betterdai): a web application that apply hardcore
data analysis and machine learning to ensure hospital patients are treated correct.

The goal is to predict which patients will be re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of their discharge. 
This is a real problem for hospitals, who don't get paid for a re-admission if it happens within 30 days 
after the patient was discharged, and patients, who would like to live their life outside the walls of 
a hospital and be healthy.

This repo includes the back-end machine learning algorithm that carries out the prediction as well as the data preprocessing and data visualization.
